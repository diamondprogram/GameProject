# GameProject

This is a passion project of mine I have been working on. I love playing videos games since I was young and always wanted to make one of mine own. This Project is is using the Unity engine to develop the game and C# as the language. This game pay homage to the classic mega man series and other side scroller platformers of the same nature.

This project is still in development.

currently there is only a single level which is just a room for the player to run and jump and a spike pit t, which kilss the player on contact resting the level.
